This is a fast library for computing the [Voronoi diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram) of a set of two-dimensional points. It is based on [Delaunator](https://github.com/mapbox/delaunator), a fast library for computing the [Delaunay triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation) using [sweep algorithms](https://github.com/mapbox/delaunator/blob/master/README.md#papers). The Voronoi diagram is constructed by connecting the circumcenters of adjacent triangles in the Delaunay triangulation.
